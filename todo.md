Virtual Art Gallery Technical Task
Project Overview:
Create a virtual art gallery platform where artists can showcase their work, and users can explore and interact with the exhibited art. The platform will be built using Django as the backend framework and Django REST Framework (DRF) for creating a RESTful API.

Key Features:
User Management:

Users can register, log in, and create profiles.
Artists should have additional features in their profiles, such as a portfolio and information about their artistic background.
Artwork Exhibition:

Artists can create exhibitions, each with a theme, description, and a curated display of artworks.
Users can view a list of exhibitions and explore individual exhibitions.
Artwork Model:

Create a model for artworks with fields like title, artist, description, image, medium (painting, sculpture, digital art), and created_at.
Include a rating and review system for each artwork.
Virtual Viewing Rooms:

Implement virtual rooms where users can view artworks in a 3D space.
Allow users to move between different exhibition rooms.
Interactive Art:

Support interactive art pieces that users can engage with (e.g., rotate, zoom, or trigger animations).
Comments and Discussions:

Users can leave comments on individual artworks or participate in discussions about specific exhibitions.
Search and Filter:

Implement a search and filter system to help users find art based on categories, styles, or artists.
User Collections:

Allow users to create and share collections of their favorite artworks.
Provide recommendations based on user preferences and collections.
Event Integration:

Allow artists to promote and schedule virtual events (e.g., live art creation sessions, Q&A sessions).
Art Sales and Commissions:

Enable artists to sell their artwork directly through the platform.
Support commission requests for custom artwork.
Authentication and Authorization:

Use Django's built-in authentication for user registration and login.
Implement role-based authorization to distinguish between regular users and artists.
Security Measures:

Ensure secure handling of sensitive information, such as user data and payment details.
Implement appropriate permissions to control access to different API endpoints.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the API provides data in a format that is conducive to responsive design on the frontend.
API Documentation:

Use Django REST Framework's built-in documentation tools to create comprehensive API documentation.
Testing:

Write unit tests for critical components of the API, including models, views, and serializers.
Deployment:

Deploy the application on a hosting platform like Heroku or AWS.
Set up a staging environment for testing before deploying changes to production.
Version Control:

Use Git for version control, with clear commit messages and branching strategies.
Analytics Dashboard (Optional):

Implement an analytics dashboard for artists to track the performance of their exhibitions and artworks.
Virtual Reality Integration (Optional):

If desired, explore adding virtual reality support for an immersive gallery experience.
Technologies:
Django 3.x
Django REST Framework
PostgreSQL (or another suitable database)
Django Channels (for real-time features, if needed)
Django OAuth Toolkit (for OAuth2 authentication, if needed)
Docker (for containerization)
Celery (for handling asynchronous tasks, e.g., sending email notifications)
Project Structure:
Django apps: users, artworks, exhibitions, comments, events, collections, etc.
Use Django REST Framework serializers to convert complex data types to Python data types.
Implement Django signals for handling actions like user registration, artwork creation, etc.
Use Django's built-in views and DRF views for handling API requests.
